Genome-wide prediction of cis-regulatory regions using Random Forest

Project work for the course of Bioinformatics of the MS in Computer Science at the University of Milan.

You can find the dataset at this link: https://homes.di.unimi.it/valenti/DATA/ProgettoBioinf1819/
Labels are in the "Classes" folder, while features are in the "epigenomic-data" folder. You have to rename them to make it work out-of-the-box with my jupyter.
